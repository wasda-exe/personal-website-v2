# personal-website-v2
My second CV website. Html, css and a tad bit of js here and there. Implemented the AOS library for scroll animations. Used animations partially powered by keyframes. Utility classes for reusability. Mainly class based styling to avoid specificity conflicts. Mobile first approach.
